# Coffee Shop Checkout

## Purpose
Implement a checkout page for a coffee app given a [design image](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/css/project). This is a project from Brian Holt's [Complete Intro to Web Dev](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/) workshop. 
I used this project to understand and apply basic CSS skills.
